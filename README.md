# RTC Unicorn

This project is my solo project. It is utilizing modern browsers' built-in APIs for RTC (real time communication).
This project is fully front-end, there is no backend web service needed. 

The purpose this project is to provide a specific user group a tool, who want to play greetings and advertises on the calls with clients. It is just a prototype for demo.
